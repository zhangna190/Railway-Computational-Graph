 # Computational Graph-based Railway Demand Estimation Toolkit

This script contains functional modules for estimating railway network demand using a computational graph-based approach.  

The input data includes ticket sales data and station information. The output data comprises:  
Estimated boarding passenger volume; OD flows, OD line flows, line section flows, behavioral parameters for the Nested Logit model. The behavioral parameters include frequency coefficients, travel time coefficients, and price coefficients for each line, as well as economic coefficients for each OD pair. The model integrates the Nested Logit model, hierarchical model, and linear regression model, while considering induced demand, diverted demand, and ex-post demand constrained by train seat capacity.

# Getting Started

## 1. Preparing Data  
Prepare a ticket_sale_data.csv file with the following fields:  
- BOARDDATE: Date of boarding  
- TRAINID: Unique identifier for the train (corresponds to train number, starting from 0)  
- TRAINNO: Train number  
- DEP_STATION_ID: Departure station ID (e.g., A-0, B-1, C-2)  
- DEP_STATION: Departure station (e.g., A, B, C)  
- DEP_TIME: Departure time  
- ARR_STATION_ID: Arrival station ID (e.g., B-1, C-2, D-3)  
- ARR_STATION: Arrival station (e.g., B, C, D)  
- ARR_TIME: Arrival time  
- PSGNUM: Number of passengers (actual tickets sold for the OD segment)  
- PRICESUM: Total ticket revenue for the OD segment  
- PRICE: Ticket price per passenger  
- BASE PSGNUM: Baseline passenger count  

## 2. Main Steps  
The model is trained using the TensorFlow library. The training process involves four interconnected steps:  
1. Training the probability of choosing each OD line using the Nested Logit model  
2. Training flows in the hierarchical structure based on flow conservation principles  
3. Training the OD-based linear regression flow model using coupling constraints  
4. Integrating results from the first three steps to generate the final estimates  

Coupling constraints and capacity constraints are enforced using the augmented Lagrangian method.  


## 3. Output Data  
The tool outputs the following 12 files:  
1. loss_figure.png  
2. nested_logit_statistic_metrics.csv

## 4.Example: Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway corridor
A 14-day ticket sales dataset collected from the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway corridor serves as a real-world case study to showcase the practical application and impact of the proposed method. The dataset includes two weeks of data: one week before the Spring Festival (January 1st, 2017, to January 7th, 2017) and one week after (February 22nd, 2017, to February 28th, 2017). These periods are selected to minimize the influence of the heightened travel demand typically seen during the Spring Festival in China.

The figure shows the line plan operated during the specified period. All train lines operate with a service frequency of 1 from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. After shuffling the dataset by days, we use the first 10 days of data as the training set and the subsequent 4 days of data as the validation set.

This figure further illustrates estimated boarding, alighting and OD demand at stations along Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail corridor. The travel time, frequency, and ticket price are collected from the real timetable operated at the time.
